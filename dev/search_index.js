We write the whole pulse as f(t) = (env(t) exp(i(phi0 + Ï‰0tr + chirp*tr^2)) + c.c. ) / 2im, where tr = t-tpeak For the fourier transform of the envelope, we include the chirp term exp(i chirp (t-tpeak)^2) in the envelope, so that its fourier transform is a complex function. However, for unchirped pulses, the result will be purely real.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
